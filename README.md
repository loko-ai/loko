LOKO AI is a **low-code platform** designed to easily and quickly create **artificial intelligence applications** to be implemented in business processes.

# How does it work?

In LOKO AI you have an entire suite of components containing **code and AI functionalities**: each component is a **block**, with its functionalities and its own code. To use the blocks in a workflow, you just have to **drag&drop** each one on the workspace and to configure them.

With LOKO AI you have **ML features** at your hands: it allows to measure **model performances** and create intelligible reports and, if you have specific needs, you can fine-tune your code with a low-code approach. Then, if necessary, you can **export** your ML model in any other platform.
