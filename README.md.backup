LOKO AI is a **low-code platform** designed to easily and quickly create **artificial intelligence applications** to be implemented in business processes.


# :computer: Releases



[Latest release](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/releases)


# How does it work?




In LOKO AI you have an entire suite of components containing **code and AI functionalities**: each component is a **block**, with its functionalities and its own code. To use the blocks in a workflow, you just have to **drag&drop** each one on the workspace and to configure them.

With LOKO AI you have **ML features** at your hands: it allows to measure **model performances** and create intelligible reports and, if you have specific needs, you can fine-tune your code with a low-code approach. Then, if necessary, you can **export** your ML model in any other platform.

## Technologies you'll find in LOKO AI

On LOKO AI you'll be able to carry out several task, using our **blocks**, which are based on the most common technologies used in the **AI** field, indepently of the type of data you have. 

### *Machine Learning and Deep Learning*

For the **ML** tasks, all the **Sklearn** regression and classification models are available and also other well known alghoritms such as **XGBoost**, **CatBoost** and **LightGBoost**. 

If you want to use a more elaborated model you can use a Neural Network model, some pre-defined version are available, which are based on **Tensorflow** and **PyTorch** technology. 

LOKO AI has an **AutoML** tool, which use **Optuna** to tune the hyper-parameter, and choose the model that performs better on your data.

### *Natural Language Processing*

If you have some files and you want to extract the text inside, you can use our **OCR blocks**, based on **Tesseract** framework.

If the data you have is textual, it is possible to apply some pre-processing through our **NLP blocks**, which use **NLTK** and **SPACY**, if needed, and extract entities using rules models or AI, through **Spacy** or **Hugging Face** frameworks, based on what fits you the best.


Finally, it's possible to manage your favourite database among the one supported, whether it is a **cloud database**, a **relational** or **non-relational** one. Currently supported database: **SQL**, **MongoDB**, **AWS**.

# Troubleshooting

## Windows

Docker Desktop requires **VT-x**, **VT-D (Intel CPUs)** or **SVM (AMD CPUs)** support enabled in the BIOS settings. 

The procedure to enable these technologies may vary, depending on BIOS appearance, organization and motherboards BIOS settings customization. VT-x could be also called *Intel Virtualization Technology* and SVM could be also called *Secure Virtual Machine*.

**Example of enabling VT-x (for Intel CPUs) in a Gigabyte motherboard:**
- Enter the BIOS *Settings*, pressing *Esc*, *Del* or F2 in the keyboard after power on
- Select *BIOS Features* and enable *Intel Virtualization Technology*

![screenshotVT-x](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/enabling%20VT-x.jpg)

- exit and save the changes

**Example of enabling SVM (for AMD CPUs) in a Asus ROG motherboard:**
- Enter the *BIOS Settings*, pressing *Esc*, *Del* or F2 in the keyboard after power on (figura) 

![screenshotVT-x1](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/enablingVT-x.1.jpg)

- press F7 to enter into *Advanced Mode*

![screenshotSVM](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/enablingVT-x.2.jpg)

- click *Advanced* and then *CPU Configuration*

![screenshotadvanced](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/enablingVT-x.3.jpg)

- set *SVM Mode* as *Enabled*
- exit and Save the changes

![screenshotSVMenabled](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/enablingVT-x.4.jpg)

### Docker Desktop can work using Hyper-V or WLS2 backend engine:

**Hyper-V** is a legacy Backend for Docker. It needs Hyper-V feature enabled which is available only on Education, Enteprice or Pro editions of Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 build 1809 (April 2018 Update)

- **Enable Hyper-V feature:**

1. Open *Start* on Windows.
2. Search for *Turn Windows features on or off* and click the top result

![screenshotturnwindows](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/turn.windows.jpg)

3. Check the *Hyper-V* option

![screenshothyperv](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/turn.windows.2.jpg)

4. Click the OK button and restart the computer.

**NOTE:** if Hyper-V feature doesn’t show up, be sure that all of the following requirements are satisfied:

- 64-bit CPU that supports Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
- VT-x (Intel CPUs) or SVM (AMD CPUs) support enabled in BIOS settings
- Windows 8 or above, Enterprise, Pro, or Education edition
- Minimum of 4 GB of RAM

**WLS2** is faster than Hyper-V Backend as it uses Windows Subsystem for Linux feature, which is only available on all editions of Windows 10 build 1903 (May 2019 Update) or higher

- **Enable WSL2 feature:**

1. Open *Start* on Windows.
2. Search for *Turn Windows features on or off* and click the top result

![screenshotturnwindows](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/turn.windows.jpg)

3. Check the *Windows Subsystem for Linux* option

![screenshotlinux](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/turn.windows.3.jpg)

4. Click the OK button and restart the computer.

Download and install the [Linux kernel update package](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi.).

Follow the usual installation instructions to install Docker Desktop. If you are running a supported system, Docker Desktop prompts you to enable **WSL2** during installation. 

Read the information displayed on the screen and enable WSL2 to continue.

To check wether Docker is using Hyper-V or WLS2 Backend engine:

- Start Docker Desktop
- From the Docker Menu click on *Settings* and select *General*
- You will see the *Use WSL2 based engine* check box

![dockerengine](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/blob/development/immagini/3.%20Docker%20Engine.jpg)


## Linux


• If there are some errors regarding FUSE in the terminal or the LOKO AI app doesn't run, try to install FUSE by following [these instructions](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE).

If FUSE is already installed, try to restart your PC:

• If in the terminal you see *Exiting GPU process due to errors during initialization*, it means that you don’t have any **HW Acceleration**, try to install or update your GPU Driver

• If in the terminal you see *libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to retrieve device information* it means that you are using an unsupported, unofficial or third-party **GPU Driver**, try to install a different GPU Driver or update your existing one

• During the first start of LOKO AI, the app will pull the required containers from a remote repository. If there are network **errors** or corrupted downloads, LOKO AI could **still run** but some functionalities could be **broken**, try to close and start again LOKO AI in order to **pull again** its containers
