LOKO AI is a **low-code platform** designed to easily and quickly create **artificial intelligence applications** to be implemented in business processes.


# Releases

:computer:

[Latest release](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/releases)

# How does it work?




In LOKO AI you have an entire suite of components containing **code and AI functionalities**: each component is a **block**, with its functionalities and its own code. To use the blocks in a workflow, you just have to **drag&drop** each one on the workspace and to configure them.

With LOKO AI you have **ML features** at your hands: it allows to measure **model performances** and create intelligible reports and, if you have specific needs, you can fine-tune your code with a low-code approach. Then, if necessary, you can **export** your ML model in any other platform.

## Technologies you'll find on LOKO AI

On LOKO AI you'll be able to carry out several task, using our **blocks**, which are based on the most common technologies used in the **AI** field, indepently of the type of data you have. 

### *Machine Learning*

For the **ML** tasks, all the **Sklearn** regression and classification models are available and also other well known alghoritms such as **XGBoost**, **CatBoost** and **LightGBoost**. 

If you want to use a more elaborated model you can use a Neural Network model, some pre-defined version are available, which are based on **Tensorflow** and **PyTorch** technology. 

LOKO AI has an **AUTOML** tool, which use **Optuna** to tune the hyper-parameter, and choose the model that performs better on your data.

### *Natural Language Processing*

If you have some files and you want to extract the text inside, you can use our **OCR blocks**, based on **Tesseract** framework.

If the data you have is textual, it is possible to apply some pre-processing through our **NLP blocks**, which use **NLTK** and **SPACY**, if needed, and extract entities using rules models or AI, through **Spacy** or **Hugging Face** frameworks, based on what fits you the best.


Finally, it's possible to manage your favourite database among the one supported, whether it is a **cloud database**, a **relational** or **non-relational** one. Currently supported database: **SQL**, **MongoDB**, **AWS**.
